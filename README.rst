Google Calendar LMS tab
-----------------------
IMPORTANT NOTE: this is a draft README for not fully implemented yet feature.


Django application that allows course staff enable new "Calendar" tab from CMS (studio).
From LMS side appears new "Calendar" tab with google calendar associated with current course.
New calendar events may be created by any enrolled student.
Calendar may be shared by stuff personal with provided google accounts (with update permission).

1) INSTALLATION

    Installation process description.


2) CONFIGURATION

    Configuration process description.


3) BASIC USAGE

    From the very beginning after calendar tab is enabled, there is no any google calendar associated with current course,
so staff has to initialize one at first time.
    After initialization new google calendar is rendered on the tab.
    Students can create/update/delete events.
    Staff can share course calendar with other google accounts.
